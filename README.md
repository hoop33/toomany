# Too Many

> Simple Core Data project demonstrating many-to-many

## How to Use

The first time you run it, it inserts data: 2 things and 2 stuffs, and relates them all to each other.

The second time you run it, it prints out the things and the stuffs and their relationships:

```
Thing 2
   Stuff 1
     Thing 2
     Thing 1
   Stuff 2
     Thing 2
     Thing 1
Thing 1
   Stuff 1
     Thing 2
     Thing 1
   Stuff 2
     Thing 2
     Thing 1
```
